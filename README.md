# Week 1 Challenge	

## Description

- Goal was to modify code in order to create accessible HTML. 
- This project was completed in order to provide accessibility for individuals with disabilities who use screen readers, video captions, and braille keyboards. 
- Doing this helped this site rank higher in search engines. It also helps to avoid litigation, and allows individuals with disabilities to view the website. 
- I learned the importance of creating semantic HTML to include all in the development process.
